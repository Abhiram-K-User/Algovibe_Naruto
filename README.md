‚ö° Naruto: Nine-Tails Chakra Network Visualizer üç•The ultimate tool for calculating and visualizing the shortest path of Chakra transmission through a network of allied Ninjas, utilizing Dijkstra's Algorithm.üåü FeaturesDijkstra's Algorithm Implementation: Calculates the shortest time (weight) for Chakra to travel from a source Ninja (Naruto) to all other Ninjas in the network.Interactive Canvas Visualization: Renders the network graph dynamically, showing the Ninjas (Nodes) and Chakra Links (Edges).Animated Chakra Flow: Visualizes the "activation" process, where Chakra particles traverse the links, illuminating the shortest paths calculated by the algorithm.Configurable Network: Easily adjust the number of Ninjas, connections, source, and query targets via the sidebar inputs.Animation Speed Control: A "Chakra Transmission Speed" slider allows you to control the visualization speed for detailed observation.Themed Design: A visually engaging theme inspired by the Naruto universe, featuring chakra effects and ninja character references.üõ†Ô∏è Technology StackThis project is a pure front-end application and uses Vanilla Web Technologies:HTML5: For the page structure and user interface elements.CSS3: For styling and dynamic background/particle effects.Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+): For all application logic, including the Dijkstra's algorithm implementation and the Canvas animation engine.HTML5 Canvas API: Used for drawing the dynamic network graph and visualization effects.No external dependencies or Node.js modules are required!üöÄ How to RunSince this is a client-side web application, deployment is straightforward:Clone or Download: Get the project files (ensure you have the three files listed below).Ensure File Structure: Make sure all files are in the same directory:index.htmlstyle.cssscript.jsLaunch in Browser: Simply double-click the index.html file. It will open in your default web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).‚öôÔ∏è Usage and ConfigurationThe sidebar allows you to define your Chakra Network graph.FieldFormatDescriptionNumber of Ninjas (N)IntegerThe total number of nodes in the graph (e.g., 4). Ninjas are numbered 1 to N.Number of Connections (M)IntegerThe total number of links/edges.Source Ninja (S)IntegerThe node ID representing Naruto, the starting point for Chakra distribution (e.g., 1).Chakra Links (u v t)Line-separated u v t triplesDefines a link between Ninja u and Ninja v with a Chakra transmission time (cost) of t. The graph is undirected.Query TargetsLine-separated IntegersA list of Ninja IDs whose minimum Chakra transmission time from the source you want to calculate.Example Input BreakdownThe default input:// Chakra Links (u v t)
1 2 100
1 3 150
2 4 200
3 4 100
2 3 50
This defines a network where:Link between Ninja 1 and 2 has a cost of 100ms.Link between Ninja 3 and 4 has a cost of 100ms.ControlsVisualize: Executes Dijkstra's algorithm, calculates the shortest paths, displays the results, and starts the animated visualization.Reset: Clears the canvas and hides the results panel, allowing for a new configuration to be tested.Chakra Transmission Speed: Adjusts the multiplier for the animation speed.üìÅ File Structure
